# 🧠 Zero to DSA

_This is my structured roadmap for learning Data Structures & Algorithms from foundational concepts to advanced techniques._

Inspired by real-world interviews and competitive programming challenges, this repo tracks my progress and includes notes, code snippets, and problem links (mostly from Leetcode).

## 🚀 Phases

### 📐 PHASE 1 — Mathematical Foundation
- Prime numbers, GCD, LCM
- Modular Arithmetic & Exponentiation
- Bitwise Operations
- Logarithms & Complexity
- Recursion
- Memory (Stack vs Heap)
- Big-O Notation (with LeetCode Cheatsheet)
- 📌 Tools: Grokking Algorithms, Leetcode Cheat Sheet

---

### 🧱 PHASE 2 — Basic Data Structures

#### Arrays & Strings
- Prefix Sum, Two Pointer, Sliding Window
- Hashing, Kadane’s Algorithm
- 🔍 Problems: Two Sum, Max Subarray, Longest Substring w/o Repeat

#### Linked Lists
- Singly, Doubly, Circular, Fast/Slow Pointers
- 🔍 Problems: Reverse List, Detect Cycle

#### Stacks & Queues
- Monotonic Stack, Valid Parentheses
- 🔍 Problems: Next Greater Element

---

### 🔁 PHASE 3 — Intermediate Data Structures

#### Hashmaps & Hashing
- Frequency Count, Anagrams, Collision Handling

#### Recursion & Backtracking
- Permutations, Subsets, Sudoku Solver

#### Trees (Binary, BST, AVL)
- Traversals, LCA, Height, Depth

---

### ⚙️ PHASE 4 — Advanced Data Structures

#### Heaps & Priority Queues
- Min/Max Heap, Kth Largest

#### Graphs
- BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Floyd-Warshall
- 🔍 Problems: Course Schedule, Islands

#### Dynamic Programming

- Knapsack, LCS, DP on Trees

---

### 🧠 PHASE 5 — Advanced Algorithms

- Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
- Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- Tries, Suffix Trees
- Heavy-Light Decomposition
